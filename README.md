# About the project:
University project **(only in Bulgarian!!!)**

I created a site for non-existent video game company. This site includes a home page, information about the company, about the team and about the partners, the games that the company offers, a gallery with gameplay from each game, upcoming events and contacts. 
### (The site was created non-professionally in almost 2 months for a course project from a university.)
