# About the project:
University project **(only in Bulgarian!!!)**

The new pizzeria "Mozzarella" is gaining rapid popularity due to its uniquely delicious pizzas made according to an Italian recipe. It stands out with its wide variety of pizzas, the freshness and quality of its ingredients, and the continuous enrichment of its menu. Soon, the pizzeria owners decide to create a website for online orders, providing greater convenience for both customers and staff. This website includes features such as:

User registration;
Easy customer ordering;
Convenient order filtering by the admin;
Addition of a new pizza type by the admin.
The first page is index.php, allowing users to log into their profiles (by entering a username and password) or, if they don't have one, to register. The registration.php page is for user registration, where users enter their name, password, and select a user type.

On the admin.php screen (accessed with username: admin, password: admin), there are several buttons: the first one filters all customer orders, the second one adds a new pizza type, and the third one allows the user to return to the index.php screen.

The filter_orders.php screen aims to filter customer orders by:

Pizza type;
Pizza size;
and to be sorted by (ascending/descending order):
ID;
Name;
Address;
Phone;
Pizza type;
Pizza size.
This screen also allows the user to return to the admin.php screen.
On the add_pizza_type.php page, the admin can enter the name of the new pizza type and add it with a button. This screen also allows the user to return to the admin.php screen.

On the usercp.php screen (accessed with username: user, password: user), the customer can place an order by entering their name, address, phone, pizza type, and its size. By clicking the "Order" button, the customer sends the order, and the data is recorded in the table. This screen also allows the user to return to the index.php screen.

The no_access.php screen is displayed only when the user does not have the right to access a specific screen. It provides the option to return to the index.php screen.
